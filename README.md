STAT363 CLT and Monte Carlo Homework 1:

-CLT: Simulated true populations.

-Drew a sample from each population.

-Obtained the sampling distribution of the sample mean using R.

-Plotted data in Base R.

-Monte Carlo Integration: approximating pi using Monte Carlo integration.


STAT363 Data Manipulation and Visualization Final Project (R):

Note: This project is listed in my CV as "**Data Cleaning and Time Series Analysis**".

-Analyzed COVID-19 vaccination rates and mortality data across U.S. states, focusing on temporal trends and inter-state variations.

-Created time series visualizations to explore the correlation between vaccination rates and COVID-19 mortality trends.

-Conducted descriptive statistics to compare pre- and post-vaccination mortality rates, assessing the impact of vaccination rollouts.

-Extracted and analyzed state-level public health policies using text mining to evaluate their influence on COVID-19 outcomes.
